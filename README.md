🎮 Welcome to Mathew's Game Design Lab
Hi there! I'm Mathew — a game designer, systems thinker, and creative problem-solver currently completing my Game Design and Programming Diploma at LaSalle College Vancouver. I blend technical precision with playful imagination to build worlds, mechanics, and experiences that spark curiosity and challenge convention.
🧠 What Drives Me
- Systems-first design — I love crafting gameplay mechanics that feel intuitive, balanced, and deeply interconnected.
- Collaborative creativity — Whether mentoring teammates or iterating on ideas, I thrive in environments that value feedback, growth, and shared vision.
- Real-world inspiration — From ferret-inspired D&D species to reputation systems shaped by industry scandals, I translate reality into meaningful game mechanics.



🔍 Featured Projects
- 🦔 Mustari Species (Homebrew D&D)
A flavorful, ferret-inspired race with unique traits and subraces. Built for balance, lore, and mechanical depth.
- 🧩 Puzzle Platformer Prototype
Designed in Unity with layered mechanics, adaptive difficulty, and narrative hooks.
🌱 From Supervisor to Storyteller
Before diving into game development, I led teams at Stormtech, driving process improvements and mentoring others. Now, I channel that leadership into collaborative design, where every mechanic tells a story and every system invites exploration.
