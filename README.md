# 🎮 Mathew's Game Design Portfolio

Hi! I'm Mathew — a game designer and developer currently completing my Game Design and Programming Diploma at LaSalle College Vancouver. I specialize in gameplay systems, collaborative design, and translating real-world inspiration into engaging mechanics.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Mechanics-first: I build systems that feel intuitive, balanced, and rewarding.
- Narrative-aware: I design with lore, context, and player immersion in mind.
- Iterative & analytical: I test, tweak, and challenge assumptions to make better games.

## 🕹️ Projects

### Wordle Clone (Unity)
A clean, responsive version of the viral word game. Includes keyboard input, feedback animations, and daily word logic.

### Zombie Wave Shooter (Unity)
Fast-paced survival shooter with wave-based enemy spawning, weapon upgrades, and score tracking.

### Mini Games Collection (Unreal Engine)
Includes Snake, Hangman, Pong, and Bomberman. Each game is built with modular logic and polished UI.

### Mustari Species (Homebrew D&D)
A ferret-inspired race with flavorful traits, subraces, and lore. Designed for balance, roleplay depth, and mechanical clarity.

## 🛠️ Skills

- Languages: C++, C#, Python
- Engines: Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot
- Tools: Maya, GitHub, Visual Studio
- Focus: Gameplay systems, world-building, UX, collaborative iteration

## 🌱 From Supervisor to Storyteller

Before game design, I led teams at Stormtech — mentoring, improving processes, and building SOPs. Now I channel that leadership into creative production, where every mechanic tells a story and every system invites exploration.
